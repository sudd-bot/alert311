# Alert311 Hourly Check - 3:00 PM Feb 10, 2026

## Status: ⚠️ Vercel Deployment Issue (22+ Hours)

### What's Working ✅
- Backend health endpoint: `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}` (0.22s response)
- Frontend: HTTP 200, site loading properly
- Database: Connected and operational
- Twilio: Configured and ready
- Core API endpoints: All functional (auth, alerts, health, docs)
- Code quality: Zero print() in backend, minimal console output in frontend
- Python syntax: All files compile without errors

### The Problem ❌
**Endpoint:** `/reports/nearby`
**Error:** `"TokenManager() takes no arguments"`
**Duration:** 22+ hours (since 5:01 AM Feb 10)

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Bug was found** at 5:00 AM - Line 270 in `token_manager.py` had `token_manager = TokenManager()` attempting to instantiate a static-only class
2. **Bug was fixed** in commit 2774ccc at 5:01 AM - Removed the instantiation line
3. **Fix is in repository** - Verified current code has NO `TokenManager()` instantiation
4. **Fix is NOT deployed** - Live Vercel endpoint still returns old error
5. **7+ deployment attempts failed** - Multiple commits pushed, none triggered successful deployment

### Why This Matters (It Doesn't Much)
- **Impact:** LOW - This is a NEW endpoint that wasn't in production before
- **Core functionality:** UNAFFECTED - Auth, alerts, health all working perfectly
- **User experience:** NO DEGRADATION - Users can't use what they never had

### What Can't Be Done Automatically
The issue is in Vercel's deployment pipeline, not the code. Requires:
1. Access to Vercel dashboard (only David has this)
2. Review deployment logs for commits 2774ccc through 69a3792
3. Check for build cache staleness or branch reference issues
4. Try manual "Redeploy" with "Clear Build Cache" option
5. Verify deployment source points to main branch HEAD
6. Check GitHub webhook/integration status

### System Health Metrics
- **Consecutive operational checks:** 165
- **Uptime:** 100% for core endpoints since Feb 3
- **Database connectivity:** 100%
- **Code quality:** Excellent (no debug statements, proper error handling)

### Next Steps
- Continue monitoring (automated hourly checks)
- Document issue for David's next review
- Wait for manual Vercel dashboard intervention
- No code changes needed - repository is correct

### Lesson Learned
Sometimes infrastructure issues can't be solved with more commits. When Vercel's deployment pipeline gets stuck, it requires dashboard access to diagnose and fix.
