### TODO Analysis
All 5 TODOs in codebase are architectural changes requiring major work:
1. JWT authentication (backend/app/routes/auth.py)
2. OAuth flow implementation (backend/app/routes/sf311_auth.py)
3. SF311 token management (backend/app/routes/cron.py)
4. Full OAuth flow (backend/app/services/sf311.py)
5. Token storage (backend/scripts/setup_311_tokens.py)

## Decision
**No action needed** - System is running perfectly. All endpoints functional, deployments working, no errors found.

## Next Actions
- Continue hourly monitoring
- Wait for David's direction on architectural improvements (JWT, OAuth)
- Monitor for any deployment issues
