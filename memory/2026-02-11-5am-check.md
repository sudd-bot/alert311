# Alert311 - 5:00 AM Hourly Check

**Date:** 2026-02-11 5:00 AM PST  
**Status:** ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

## Summary
All systems running perfectly. 179th consecutive operational check.

## What Was Checked
1. ✅ Backend health endpoint - Responding in 0.64s with database connected
2. ✅ Frontend - HTTP 200, loading properly
3. ✅ Real data integration - `/reports/nearby` returning live SF 311 reports
4. ✅ Code quality - Zero print() statements, proper error handling
5. ✅ Python syntax - All files compile without errors
6. ✅ Error handling - 45 instances across routes
7. ✅ Accessibility - 8 aria attributes in UI
8. ✅ Database indexes - Properly configured for performance
9. ✅ Git status - Clean working tree

## Real Data Verification
Tested `/reports/nearby` with lat=37.7749, lng=-122.4194:
- Returned 5 parking violation reports
- Dates: Feb 9-11, 2026
- Includes addresses, lat/lng, photo URLs
- Mix of open/closed statuses

## TODOs Found
All 4 TODOs require major architectural changes:
- JWT authentication (auth.py)
- Full OAuth flow for SF 311 (sf311_auth.py, sf311.py)
- Token handling improvements (cron.py)

These are documented but require David's approval before implementing.

## Action Taken
- Updated STATUS.md with check results
- Committed changes to git (commit 8b8d4d9)
- No fixes needed - system stable

## Decision
**No action needed.** System running perfectly. All endpoints functional, real data integration working, no errors detected.
