# Hourly Check - 5:00 PM (Feb 3, 2026)

## Status: ✅ All Systems Operational

### Backend Health Check
- ✅ **API responding:** `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}`
- ✅ **Deployment:** https://backend-sigma-nine-42.vercel.app
- ✅ **Database:** Connected to Neon Postgres
- ✅ **Health endpoint:** Working correctly

### Frontend Check
- ✅ **Deployment:** https://alert311-ui.vercel.app  
- ✅ **Map rendering:** Mapbox loading correctly
- ✅ **UI components:** All panels and buttons working
- ✅ **Console:** No errors
- ✅ **Mock data:** Displaying correctly (Sidewalk Parking, Illegal Dumping, Graffiti)

### Code Review
- ✅ **Recent commits:** Clean git history, working tree clean
- ✅ **Error handling:** Comprehensive (23 HTTPException cases in backend)
- ✅ **Frontend error handling:** Try-catch blocks with user-friendly toast messages
- ✅ **Logging:** All print() statements replaced with proper logging (done at noon)
- ✅ **Input validation:** Phone number and address validation in place (done at 1 PM)
- ✅ **Security:** CORS restricted, no exposed secrets

### TODOs Found
- JWT authentication (auth.py) - **Requires David's approval** (major change)
- OAuth flow for SF 311 (sf311_auth.py, sf311.py) - **Requires David's approval** (major feature)

### Deployment Status
- ✅ **Last deployment:** Commit `02b39c0` (4 PM bug fix - report type mapping)
- ✅ **Auto-deployment:** Working correctly from git pushes
- ✅ **Environment variables:** All configured in Vercel

### Potential Improvements Considered
All would require David's approval (could impact functionality):
1. **Rate limiting** - Would need to choose limits and test
2. **Response caching** - Could affect real-time data
3. **Bundle size optimization** - Requires build config changes
4. **External error tracking** (Sentry) - New service integration

## Action Taken
✅ **No changes made** - All systems healthy, no bugs found, no urgent improvements needed

## Next Check
- Continue monitoring at 6:00 PM
- Watch for deployment errors
- Check for any new feature opportunities

---

**Conclusion:** System is stable and performing well. Last bug fix (report type mapping at 4 PM) is deployed and working correctly. No issues detected.
