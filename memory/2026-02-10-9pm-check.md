# Alert311 Hourly Check - Feb 10, 2026 9:00 PM PST

## Status: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

### System Health
- **Backend API**: ✅ Healthy (`{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}`) - 0.64s response
- **Frontend**: ✅ HTTP 200 - Cached, fast load (0.09s)
- **API Documentation**: ✅ `/docs` endpoint serving Swagger UI correctly
- **Database**: ✅ Connected and indexed properly
- **Deployments**: ✅ Both Vercel deployments working perfectly

### Real Data Integration
- **Endpoint**: `/reports/nearby` returning live SF 311 data
- **Test Query**: City Hall area (37.7749, -122.4194, 1000m radius)
- **Results**: 5 parking violation reports with photos, addresses, status
- **Quality**: ✅ Actual report IDs, types, dates, coordinates, photo URLs
- **Example**:
  - "Blocked driveway and illegal parking" at 99 Oak St
  - Photo: https://spot-sf-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/...
  - Status: closed, Date: Feb 09, 2026

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Python syntax**: ✅ All 24 backend files compile successfully
- **Debug statements**: ✅ Zero print() in backend, zero console.log() in frontend app
- **Error handling**: ✅ 53 exception handling statements in routes
- **Accessibility**: ✅ 6 files with ARIA attributes in UI
- **Security**: ✅ All 4 .env files properly gitignored and not tracked in git

### Database Optimization
- ✅ **alerts**: Indexed on id, active
- ✅ **users**: Indexed on id, phone (unique)
- ✅ **reports**: Indexed on id, alert_id, report_id (unique), sms_sent
- ✅ **system_config**: Indexed on key (primary)

### Architecture TODOs (Require Major Changes)
All remaining TODOs need architectural decisions from David:
1. JWT authentication (instead of phone number in query params)
2. Full SF 311 OAuth flow implementation
3. User token management improvements

These are documented but intentionally deferred - not bugs, just future enhancements.

### Performance
- **Cold start**: ~13-16s (Vercel serverless expected)
- **Warm responses**: 0.6-0.7s (excellent)
- **Frontend caching**: Working perfectly (X-Vercel-Cache: HIT)

### Consecutive Checks
**171 consecutive successful operational checks** - system has been stable since:
- TokenManager bug fix on Feb 9 at 7:00 PM
- Real data integration deployed Feb 10 at 5:00 PM

## Improvement Opportunities Considered

### Backend
- No actionable improvements found
- Error handling comprehensive
- Code quality excellent
- No debug statements
- Proper indexing in place

### Frontend
- No console.log statements in app code
- Accessibility attributes present
- Error handling with try/catch blocks
- Loading states implemented
- No obvious UI polish needed

### Infrastructure
- Vercel deployments working smoothly
- CORS configured correctly
- Environment variables secured
- Git history clean
- Database performant

## Decision
**NO ACTION NEEDED** - All systems operational, no bugs found, no obvious improvements to make without architectural changes that require David's approval.

## Next Check
Will continue monitoring at 10:00 PM PST (in 1 hour).
