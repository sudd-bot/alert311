# Alert311 Hourly Check - Feb 12, 2026 11:00 AM

## Status: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

### System Health
- **Backend**: Healthy, database connected (0.64s response)
- **Frontend**: HTTP 200, loading properly
- **API Docs**: Accessible and serving correctly
- **Real Data**: Live SF 311 reports returning properly (parking violations)

### Code Quality
- **Backend**: 0 print() statements, 45 exception handlers
- **Frontend**: 0 console.log() (only console.error for proper error handling)
- **Python**: All files compile without syntax errors
- **Accessibility**: 8 aria attributes
- **Database**: Proper indexing verified on all key fields

### Database Indexes Verified
- alerts.id (primary key)
- alerts.active (for cron queries)
- users.id (primary key)
- users.phone (unique, for lookups)
- reports.id (primary key)
- reports.alert_id (for finding reports by alert)
- reports.report_id (unique, for deduplication)
- reports.sms_sent (for cron queries)

### TODOs Found
All 4 TODOs require major architectural changes:
1. JWT authentication replacement (app/routes/auth.py)
2. SF 311 OAuth flow token handling (app/routes/cron.py)
3. Full OAuth flow implementation (app/routes/sf311_auth.py)
4. Full OAuth flow implementation (app/services/sf311.py)

These require David's approval before implementation.

### Metrics
- **Consecutive Operational Checks**: 209
- **Git Status**: Clean working tree
- **Deployments**: Both working perfectly

### Decision
No action needed. System running flawlessly with 209 consecutive operational checks. All endpoints functional, deployments stable, real data integration verified. All potential improvements require major architectural changes that need David's approval.
