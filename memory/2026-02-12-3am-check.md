# Alert311 - 3:00 AM Check (2026-02-12)

## Status: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

### Health Checks
- ✅ **Backend health:** `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}` (0.84s response)
- ✅ **Frontend:** HTTP 200 (0.12s)
- ✅ **API docs:** HTTP 200 (`/docs` endpoint accessible)
- ✅ **Real data integration:** 10 live SF 311 reports returned

### Real Data Sample
Query: `lat=37.7749&lng=-122.4194&radius_miles=1`

Returned 10 parking violations (Feb 4-11) including:
- 455 Fell St (Feb 11, open, no photo)
- 99 Oak St (Feb 09, closed, with photo)
- 79 Franklin St (Feb 09, closed, with photo)
- 196 Oak St (Feb 09, open, with photo)
- 248 10 Th St (Feb 09, open, with photo)
- And 5 more reports...

All reports have:
- Proper addresses
- Accurate lat/lng coordinates
- Photo URLs (when available)
- Status (open/closed)
- Date stamps

### Code Quality Analysis
- ✅ **Debug statements:** Zero `print()` in backend app, zero `console.log()` in frontend app code
- ✅ **Python syntax:** All backend files compile without errors
- ✅ **Error handling:** 45 `try/except/raise HTTPException` usages in backend routes
- ✅ **Accessibility:** 1 `aria-*` attribute in UI components (low but acceptable)

### Database Analysis
- ✅ **Indexes verified:**
  - `alerts.active` (indexed for cron job queries)
  - `users.phone` (indexed and unique)
  - `reports.alert_id` (indexed, foreign key to alerts)
  - `reports.report_id` (indexed, unique, SF 311 report ID)
  - `reports.sms_sent` (indexed for cron job queries)

### TODO Analysis
Found 4 TODOs, all requiring major architectural changes:
1. `app/routes/auth.py` - "Replace with proper JWT authentication"
2. `app/routes/cron.py` - "Update sf311_client to accept raw token instead of user object"
3. `app/routes/sf311_auth.py` - "Implement full OAuth flow in the app itself"
4. `app/services/sf311.py` - "Implement full OAuth flow"

**Decision:** All TODOs require architectural changes and should be discussed with David first.

### Git Status
Working tree clean. Only untracked memory files from previous checks:
- `backend/init_token.py` (utility script)
- 26 memory files from previous checks

### System Stability
- **Consecutive successful checks:** 201 ✅
- **Deployments:** Both frontend and backend stable on Vercel
- **Database:** Neon Postgres connected and responding
- **Twilio:** Credentials configured
- **API endpoints:** All functional

### Decision
**No action needed.** System running perfectly. All services operational, no errors found, no urgent improvements identified. All remaining TODOs require major architectural discussion.

**Next check:** 4:00 AM PST
