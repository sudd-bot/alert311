# Alert311 - Hourly Check (3:00 PM PST, Feb 11 2026)

## Status: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

### Deployments
- **Backend**: `https://backend-sigma-nine-42.vercel.app`
  - Health check: ✅ `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}` (0.63s)
  - API docs: ✅ `/docs` accessible and serving Swagger UI
  - Real data: ✅ `/reports/nearby` returning 2 live SF 311 reports
  
- **Frontend**: `https://alert311-ui.vercel.app`
  - Status: ✅ HTTP 200 with proper caching headers
  - Build: ✅ Next.js builds successfully (minor @next/swc version warning, non-critical)

### Code Quality
- ✅ Zero debug statements (no print() in backend, no console.log() in app code)
- ✅ All Python files compile without errors
- ✅ 42+ exception handling blocks in backend routes
- ✅ 8 aria-label attributes for accessibility
- ✅ Frontend build successful with proper optimization

### TODOs Found
All 4 TODOs require major architectural changes that need David's approval:
1. JWT authentication (instead of phone-based auth)
2. Full OAuth flow for SF 311
3. Proper token handling in cron jobs
4. Complete OAuth implementation

### System Stability
- **189 consecutive operational checks** - no issues found
- All endpoints functional
- Database connected and indexed properly
- Deployments working perfectly
- Real SF 311 data integration successful

## Decision
✅ **No action needed** - System running perfectly. All improvements identified would require major architectural changes that need David's approval. Will continue monitoring.

## Next Check
