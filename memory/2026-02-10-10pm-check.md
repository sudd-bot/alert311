# Alert311 - 10:00 PM Check (Feb 10, 2026)

## Status: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

### Health Checks
- **Backend:** `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}` (0.20s response)
- **Frontend:** HTTP 200, loading properly
- **API Docs:** Swagger UI accessible at `/docs`
- **Real Data:** `/reports/nearby` returning live SF 311 data successfully

### Live Data Verification
Successfully retrieved 5 real SF 311 reports near Oak St/Franklin St:
- Blocked driveway and illegal parking reports
- Complete with photos, addresses, coordinates
- Mix of open and closed tickets (Feb 6-9, 2026)
- Photo URLs working from Cloudinary CDN

### Code Quality
- ✅ Zero `print()` statements in backend
- ✅ Zero `console.log()` in frontend app code
- ✅ All Python files compile without errors
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully (Next.js)
- ✅ 7 accessibility attributes (aria-label/role)
- ✅ Proper database model structure (user, alert, report, system_config)

### System Stability
- **172 consecutive operational checks** 🎉
- All endpoints functional
- Deployments working perfectly
- Database connected and indexed properly
- CORS configured correctly

### TODOs Reviewed
All 4 TODOs require major architectural changes:
- JWT authentication system
- Full SF 311 OAuth flow
These are documented and await David's approval.

### Minor Warnings (Non-Critical)
- `@next/swc` version mismatch (15.5.7 vs 15.5.11) - cosmetic warning
- ESLint config import error - doesn't affect build/deployment

### Action Taken
- Updated STATUS.md with check results
- Incremented consecutive checks counter (171 → 172)
- Committed changes to main branch
- No fixes needed - system running perfectly

### Conclusion
**No action needed.** Alert311 is stable, healthy, and serving real SF 311 data successfully. Ready for user testing when A2P campaign is approved.
