# Hourly Check - Feb 10, 2026 2:00 PM

## Status Summary
✅ **Core Systems Operational** - 164 consecutive successful checks
- Backend health check: 0.64s response time
- Frontend: Loading properly (HTTP 200)
- Database: Connected and responsive
- All API endpoints functional (except new `/reports/nearby`)

⚠️ **Vercel Deployment Issue Persists** - 21+ hours
- `/reports/nearby` endpoint still returning old error
- Code fix is correct in repository (commit 2774ccc from Feb 9 5:01 AM)
- No `TokenManager()` instantiation anywhere in codebase
- All TokenManager methods are properly defined as static
- 7+ deployment attempts have failed to deploy the fix
- **Root cause:** Vercel deployment pipeline not syncing with main branch
- **Impact:** Low - only affects new endpoint, all core features working
- **Resolution:** Requires David's manual intervention via Vercel dashboard

## Code Quality Check
✅ All checks passed:
- Zero `print()` statements in backend app code (only in test files)
- Zero `console.log()` in frontend app code
- All Python files compile without syntax errors
- Database indexes properly defined in models
- Error handling in place (34 HTTPException/try blocks in routes)

## TODOs Reviewed
All 6 TODOs require major architectural changes:
- JWT authentication implementation
- SF 311 OAuth flow in app
- Real reports API integration
- None are quick wins for automated hourly check

## New Work Detected
- `frontend/app/new/page.tsx` modified (untracked)
- Appears to be new design work in progress
- Not breaking anything, left untracked as intended

## Actions Taken
- Updated STATUS.md with 2:00 PM check results
- Incremented consecutive checks counter to 164
- Committed and pushed documentation update
- No code changes needed (all systems operational except known Vercel issue)

## Next Steps
- Continue hourly monitoring
- Vercel issue will be included in 8 PM daily summary for David
- No automated fix possible - requires Vercel dashboard access
- Will resume incremental improvements once deployment pipeline is fixed
