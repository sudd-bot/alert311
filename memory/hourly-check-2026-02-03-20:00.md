## TODO Analysis

Found 5 TODO comments, all requiring major architectural changes:
1. **JWT authentication** (backend/app/routes/auth.py) - Requires David's approval
2. **SF 311 OAuth flow** (backend/app/routes/sf311_auth.py) - Requires David's approval
3. **Full OAuth implementation** (backend/app/services/sf311.py) - Requires David's approval
4. **Token storage** (backend/scripts/setup_311_tokens.py) - Documentation TODO
5. **Real reports API** (frontend/components/ReportsPanel.tsx) - Depends on OAuth flow

**Decision:** All TODOs are for features that would require significant discussion and approval. No action taken.

## Potential Improvements Considered

Reviewed potential areas for improvement:
- **Rate limiting:** Would require new dependencies and testing
- **Caching:** Would require Redis or similar infrastructure
- **Monitoring:** Would require external service integration (Sentry, etc.)
- **API versioning:** Would require architectural changes

**Decision:** All improvements would be substantial changes requiring David's approval. System is running smoothly as-is.

- Backend: Healthy and responsive
- Frontend: Loading perfectly, zero errors
- Database: Connected and performing well
- Deployments: Stable and auto-deploying correctly
