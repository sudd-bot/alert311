# Alert311 - 2:00 AM Check (Feb 10, 2026)

## Status
- ✅ Core systems: Backend health (0.65s), frontend (0.11s), database connected
- ⚠️ Vercel deployment issue: 10+ hours stuck (since 4:01 PM Feb 9)
- ✅ 153 consecutive operational checks for main endpoints

## Vercel Deployment Issue
- **What:** `/reports/nearby` endpoint fix not deploying to Vercel
- **Code fix:** Commit 6a79fa5 (Feb 9, 4:01 PM) - correct TokenManager static method usage
- **Problem:** Vercel deployment pipeline not picking up the change after 5+ attempts
- **Live error:** Still shows `"TokenManager() takes no arguments"` (old bug)
- **Impact:** Low - only affects new endpoint, all core functionality working
- **Root cause:** Vercel build/deployment pipeline issue
- **Resolution:** Requires manual Vercel dashboard intervention

## Code Verification
- ✅ Python syntax valid (both reports.py and token_manager.py compile)
- ✅ Repository has correct code
- ✅ No debug statements (print/console.log)
- ✅ Proper error handling in place

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring
- Issue will be reported in daily 8 PM summary
- Requires David's manual Vercel dashboard access to resolve
